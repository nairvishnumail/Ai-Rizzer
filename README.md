## Project Overview

The AI Rizz Master project utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to empower chatbots with the ability to engage users in a more persuasive and alluring manner. By integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, the project leaps beyond conventional chatbot interactions and ventures into the realm of nuanced social dynamics. It's an intricate blend of technology and art, a digital Casanova coded to "rizz up" AI chatbots, making them swoon over its textual allure.

## Features

- **Playwright Integration**: Automates web interactions with chatbot platforms using Playwright, a robust browser automation library.
- **BeautifulSoup for Parsing**: Parses HTML content extracted from chatbot platforms using BeautifulSoup for seamless message processing.
- **Smart Delay Handling**: Implements a delay strategy to manage and mitigate rate limits when communicating with OpenAI's API.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains conversation context to provide coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Sign-In Automation**: Automates the sign-in process to the platform using user credentials stored securely.
- **Response Validation**: Checks the AI's responses against desired outcomes to ensure the conversation is on track.
- **Adaptable to Multiple Platforms**: Designed with modularity in mind to easily extend support to other AI chatbot platforms.
